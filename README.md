# device-linking

The idea is to establish a temporary, secure link between two devices so they can sync state or pass data (e.g., control app, authentication, file transfer, etc.).


## Components
* A shared backend or signaling server to hold state and coordinate connections.

* A way for the mobile device to initiate a session (e.g., generate a session token).

* A way for the laptop app to “join” the session, typically by scanning a QR code or entering a short code.

* A real-time communication channel (e.g., WebSockets or polling).

* A callback/event system to sync or send data as needed.
